<h3>(2) Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.</p>
<p>We may use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies on the website. We will use the session cookies to: keep track of you whilst you navigate the website and also other uses. In addition, we will use the persistent cookies to: enable our website to recognise you when you &amp; other uses visit our website.</p>
<p>Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.</p>
<p>Our advertisers/payment services providers may also send you cookies.</p>
<p>We may publish product or ingredient or other related interest-based advertisements on our website. These are tailored by Perfume Land to enhance the website and to reflect your interests. To determine your interests, we or our web administrator will track your behaviour across the web using cookies. You can view, delete or add interest categories associated with your browser.</p>
<p>Most browsers allow you to reject all cookies, whilst some browsers allow you to reject just third party cookies. For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector. Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.</p>
